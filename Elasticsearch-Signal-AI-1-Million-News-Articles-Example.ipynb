Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \\n \\n\"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \\n \\n\"It\\'s generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month\\'s meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" \\n \\nHe said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. \\n \\nMr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put \\'reserved for the armed forces\\'. \\n   Promoted stories   \\nThe reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. \\n \\nHe was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. \\n \\nMr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. \\n \\nThe Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. \\n \\nThe management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. \\n   \\n Share article  \\n   \\nThe next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. \\n \\nThe breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.', 'title': 'Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders', 'media-type': 'News', 'source': 'Redditch Advertiser', 'published': '2015-09-07T10:16:14Z'}\n"

Five out of the 10 that attended said they saw the article in the newspaper and turned up. \\n \\n\"We even had an old chap travel from Droitwich and he was late on parade by three hours. \\n \\n\"It\\'s generated a lot of interest and I estimate (from other veterans who saw the article) that next month\\'s meeting will attract about 20 people. Onwards and upwards.\" \\n \\nHe said the management at the pub had been extremely hospitable to them. \\n \\nMr Carney said: \"They bent over backwards for us. They really looked after us well. That is the best choice of venue I could have made. They even put \\'reserved for the armed forces\\'. \\n   Promoted stories   \\nThe reserve veteran with the Royal Engineers wanted to go to a breakfast club but found the nearest ones were in Bromsgrove and Gloucester so he decided to set up his own, closer to home. \\n \\nHe was influenced by Derek Hardman who set up a breakfast club for veterans in Hull and Andy Wilson who set one up in Newcastle. He said the idea has snowballed and there were now 70 similar clubs across the country and even some in Germany. \\n \\nMr Carney said with many Royal British Legion clubs closing he wanted veterans and serving personnel to feel they had somewhere they could go for good grub, beer and banter to recapture the comradery of being in the forces. \\n \\nThe Postal Order was chosen because of its central location and its proximity to the railway station and hotels and reasonably priced food and drink. \\n \\nThe management of the pub have even given the veterans a designated area within the pub. \\n   \\n Share article  \\n   \\nThe next meeting is at the Postal Order on Saturday, October 3 at 10am. \\n \\nThe breakfast club meets on the first Saturday of each month for those who want to attend in future.', 'title': 'Worcester breakfast club for veterans gives hunger its marching orders', 'media-type': 'News', 'source': 'Redditch Advertiser', 'published': '2015-09-07T10:16:14Z'}\n"

      "   Source: {'id': '79435fde-ce56-40e3-ae9e-fb1e92b4aed4', 'content': 'Hey guys! Yet again, I am seriously sorry for the lack of posts recently. Everything’s still a little bit crazy at the moment, but I really hope things will start to become clearer in the next couple of weeks, so that should mean more posts! Yay! So for those of you who haven’t been reading my blog posts for the last month, I am at University now, and I am in temporary accommodation while I’m trying to sort out something long-term, which has proven to be far more difficult than I thought. I went to look at a house today to lodge in for the year, but it wasn’t really what I was looking for, even though it is super close to the university. It kinda sucked but I want to be somewhere that I’m going to be happy in, so the search continues. Last night I went to a Karaoke Event on campus, and I met up with a couple of friends (who I didn’t know would be there) and it was a great night. I didn’t get up and sing, because I have a really bad cough and I’d rather not make everyone go deaf with my singing, so I just sat and watched, and occasionally joined in with the big numbers that everyone knew. I then went back to my friend’s flat for a bit- well, it was intended to be for\\xa0a bit, but I left at about ten to midnight! The karaoke ended at 11pm. So… yeah… girls talk a lot, so it’s not really that surprising. Tomorrow I’m going to a thing called “Detention”, which will have alternative music (Muse, Blink 182, Foo Fighters, All American Rejects, Fall Out Boy, and many more) which I’m looking forward to, because they’ll be playing songs I actually know for once! Not that I don’t know any pop songs, but these are songs and bands I really love so it should be good. The other reason why I’m looking forward to tomorrow is because I joined the Ultimate Frisbee Club last week, and we went to the pub afterwards and some of the guys there said they’re also going to Detention so I will know some people, rather than turning up on my own like the loser I am. But going back to Ultimate Frisbee, I never realised how much like Netball it is. You’re not allowed to move when you have the Frisbee, and you have to mark other players- it’s basically netball with out the ball… or the net… What else have I been doing… I have started reading Crown of Midnight, the second book in Sarah J. Maas’s Throne of Glass series, and if you haven’t read Throne of Glass, what are you still doing here? They’re so good. I also read The Assassin’s Blade before Crown of Midnight, and there are so many things that make so much more sense in the second book of the series. I’m going to write specifically about things I have learnt from Crown of Midnight, so if you don’t want any spoilers, go to the\\xa0next paragraph! Okay, so\\xa0I hate love triangles, because they just get me really frustrated and I remember reading Throne of Glass, and Celaena gets with Dorian rather than Chaol and I’m on Team Chaol and I got really annoyed with Celaena for doing that but NOW OMG she’s chosen the right guy and I’m really happy and my fangirl heart is going to explode in a minute. I haven’t finished the book yet, I’m at the bit when Chaol and Celaena have… you know… done it, and Dorian is trying to find answers about the magical thing and he’s about to go to the creepy witch. So we can all fangirl together up to that point but if you ruin anything for me… I will get very annoyed, very quickly. Okay and we’re back. So what else have I been up to… My friend’s flatmate is an amazing baker, and she has introduced me to Snickerdoodles, and they are literally heaven. I’m not even joking, they’re probably the best thing I’ve tasted ever and they’re just so good and *drools*. They’re so addictive, so let’s fangirl about how good snickerdoodles are in the comments. If you haven’t had snickerdoodles before, you are seriously missing out. Go and find a recipe online and bake those beauties because you won’t regret it. Trust me. Talking about baking, I’ve started watching Bake Off! I don’t normally watch it religiously,\\xa0but I’ve watched the last three or four episodes every week and I’ve come to the conclusion that I would never go on Bake Off, not because I don’t like baking or that I can’t bake, but simply because of the amount of pressure you’re under. You have a time limit, and you also have to make something to perfection and I am not a perfectionist, at all. (Depending on the situation.) So if I was on Bake Off, I would probably skim read the recipe and miss out important details and then just make it up to be something completely different, and when Paul and Mary come over to look at my “final piece” I would say that it was my own interpretation. And they’d say “well it’s not what we’re looking for.” and I’d start crying in the corner. I wouldn’t actually do that, but… that’s why I wouldn’t go on Bake Off. This post has really taken a turn for the worst. I apologise, this was not what I was intending to write about… I ramble. You should\\xa0know that by now. Downton Abbey is back, and I love it so much, and I thought the first episode was okay… but I’m still waiting for the drama to really come in. I want everything to be chaotic like Downton normally is and I’m just getting excited about certain things (Like the Carson/Hughes wedding eeeeekk!!) It makes me sad that this is the last season, but at the same time I think there’s only a certain amount that Julian Fellowes can really do with the show, so I just hope that it will have a good, solid ending. # Doctor Who is back, and I’ve missed the last two episodes, so don’t even mention it. I know. It’s shocking that I call myself a Whovian, but I will get on it as soon as possible! Now there are 101 different things I want to talk about, but it’s nearly 2:30pm and I haven’t had lunch yet, so I will leave you with that. Again, I am sorry about the lack of posts, but you’re probably going to have to put up with Update posts for the next few days/weeks. Make sure you follow me on Twitter for any other updates, because I’m almost always on Twitter, but otherwise, I will see you all soon. -The Storyteller', 'title': 'University Update!', 'media-type': 'Blog', 'source': 'The Storyteller', 'published': '2015-09-27T13:28:13Z'}\n",

A city that is rich in history, rich in the culture of music, literature, art, film and, of course, the altbier (old beer). A city that is also blessed with the Heinrich Heine Institute, the Goethe Museum, the Robert Schumann Saal and the Altstadt, or old town, which enjoys a deserved reputation as home to the \"longest bar in the world\".\\n\\nAll good reasons, I\\'m sure, behind Dusseldorf\\'s lofty place in this year\\'s Mercer Quality of Living rankings.\\n\\nYes, Dusseldorf finished sixth out of more than 200 global cities.\\n\\nOf course, I am here, leading a high-level Hong Kong business mission, to sample more than your city\\'s famed top-fermented beer, though that does seem reason enough, especially paired with a curled bratwurst and a flourish of mostert (traditional mustard).\\n\\nBeyond the beer and bratwurst, we\\'re here because of Dusseldorf\\'s standing as a city of commerce and trade. A magnet for more than 5 000 international companies. A metropolis at the heart of Europe, with more than 150 million people living within a radius of 500 kilometres.\\n\\nThat, I\\'m told, takes in nearly one-third of the European Union\\'s population and half of its purchasing power.\\n\\nWe\\'re here because Hong Kong and Dusseldorf have a good deal in common. Your glittering Rhine reminds me of Hong Kong\\'s Victoria Harbour. Indeed, our two global cities began as humble fishing villages before turning to trade, industry, logistics and telecommunications, before attracting a world of business.\\n\\nAnd now there\\'s even more to bring us together.\\n\\nYesterday evening, we celebrated the formal launch of Cathay Pacific Airways\\' direct passenger flights between Hong Kong and Dusseldorf. Direct flights make business and leisure travel much easier. And I\\'m confident they will boost exchanges between us - in business, people, ideas, culture, travel and beer, too.\\n\\nExcellent reasons for us to be here today, to be looking to Dusseldorf as we redouble our business and trade focus on Germany.\\n\\nThis year, of course, is a special year.\\n\\nNext week, Germany celebrates its 25th anniversary as a reunified nation. The challenges you have overcome as a nation reunified, after decades of division, are monumental. Germany today is an undisputed global economic powerhouse, accounting for some 20 per cent of the EU\\'s GDP.\\n\\nSo, yes, it\\'s comforting to know that Hong Kong and Germany enjoy close, mutually beneficial economic relations.\\n\\nLast year, our bilateral trade was worth some 14 billion Euros (about HK$130 billion), making Germany our largest trading partner in Europe.\\n\\nGerman exporters make good use of Hong Kong\\'s gateway role to reach huge markets in Mainland China and across Asia. In 2014, 10 billion Euros (HK$91.4 billion) worth of trade between Germany and the Mainland was routed through Hong Kong.\\n\\nAnd there\\'s much more, for all of us, down the Silk Road Economic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road. Launched by the Mainland in late 2013, the initiatives target more than 60 economies linking Asia, Africa, the Middle East and, yes, Europe.\\n\\nThe Belt-Road is designed to expand transcontinental connectivity, to promote economic, political and cultural development in vast areas of three continents.\\n\\nAnd I believe it can be the force that drives the global economy in the coming decades.\\n\\nThe enthusiastic response to the establishment of the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) underscores my optimism. The AIIB will be the key financial institution supporting infrastructure development, much needed in countries along the Belt-Road. And it\\'s obvious that many nations see the promise it offers.\\n\\nGermany, the economic dynamo at the heart of Europe, is well positioned to take part.\\n\\nLocated at the western end of the Silk Road Economic Belt and the Chongqing-Xinjiang-Europe International Railway, Germany is the essential connection between the Belt to the east and the rest of Western Europe to the west.\\n\\nDusseldorf has much to gain from the Belt and Road, given its central location, its convenient ocean, road and air transport, its mature highway system and easily accessible shipping on the Rhine.\\n\\nIn the next few minutes, I\\'d like to explain how Hong Kong can serve and support German business, how we can help you capitalise on the wealth of opportunities that will emerge from the Belt-Road over the next few years and through this 21st century.\\n\\nThe Belt-Road will trigger soaring investment in infrastructural facilities. It will deepen financial integration and expand the flow of trade and the building of people-to-people bonds on an unprecedented scale.\\n\\nAnd Hong Kong will help make it happen, thanks to the unique advantages presented by our \"one country, two systems\" arrangement, under which Hong Kong maintains its own social and economic systems, while being part of China.\\n\\nTake our financial system. Hong Kong has its own currency which is different from the Mainland Renminbi and is fully convertible.\\n\\nCapital from the Mainland and from all over the world flows freely in and out of Hong Kong on a fair and equitable basis.\\n\\nIndeed, less than two weeks ago, Hong Kong was once again named \"the most economically free jurisdiction in the world\" by Canada\\'s Fraser Institute, in its annual \"Economic Freedom of the World\" report. And earlier this year, the Washington-based Heritage Foundation named Hong Kong the freest economy in the world - for 21 years in a row.\\n\\nChina\\'s major international financial centre, and one of the world\\'s financial capitals, Hong Kong has the experience, the expertise and the connections to serve as the fundraising and financial management hub for the Belt-Road. Our financing options range from public offerings and loan syndication to private equity funds and the raising of funds through Islamic finance.\\n\\nWe have the seventh largest stock market in terms of market capitalisation and rank second, globally, in equity funds raised through initial public offerings.\\n\\nHong Kong is also the world\\'s largest offshore Renminbi business centre.\\n\\nWe can provide international investors with Renminbi services ranging from cross-border trade settlement to bond issuance. As trade and other economic activities along the Belt-Road expand, so, too, will the demand for Renminbi trade settlement. Hong Kong can respond to that demand.\\n\\nAfter all, we\\'ve been handling the lion\\'s share of Renminbi trade settlement since its beginnings in 2009.\\n\\nOur Renminbi debt market has grown rapidly in recent years as well. It provides a reliable channel for companies looking to issue Renminbi bonds to meet project funding needs. Last year, the issuance of Renminbi bonds in Hong Kong amounted to some RMB200 billion - a year-on-year increase of some 70 per cent.\\n\\nWe expect the growth potential of Shariah-compliant financial services to be equally promising, given the large Muslim population living along the Belt-Road.\\n\\nHong Kong is well positioned to take advantage of those opportunities.\\n\\nIn fact, the Hong Kong Government successfully issued two sukuk over the past year, demonstrating the viability of our sukuk issuance and the confidence international investors have in Hong Kong, in our economic fundamentals and in our financial expertise.\\n\\nThe long list of infrastructure projects anticipated under the Belt-Road initiative will also boost demand for asset and risk management services.\\n\\nHong Kong\\'s wealth and asset management business has soared in recent years. And I\\'m confident we\\'re well positioned to serve as a global centre for asset management, risk management and corporate treasury activities.\\n\\nHong Kong boasts a wide variety of insurance services and derivative products as well. They offer sound reason for German companies to manage their risks by setting up captive insurers in Hong Kong.\\n\\nHong Kong\\'s deep pool of world-class services professionals, in finance, accounting, law, architecture, engineering management and more, is another strength.\\n\\nBeyond financial capital and expertise, they have the international experience to lead consultancies, construction projects, and the operations and management of Belt-Road infrastructure projects.\\n\\nMoreover, our legal professionals work with a world of business every day. They conduct due diligence, ensure contract enforcement and help resolve disputes. And they do so under a system supported by the twin foundations of the rule of law and an independent judiciary.\\n\\nHong Kong is the ideal centre for resolving potential commercial disputes arising from business collaboration.\\n\\nLadies and gentlemen, Hong Kong was built on trade, and we remain one of the world\\'s great trading economies. Our geographical location, at the southern gateway to Mainland China, gives us unparalleled trade opportunities. Our free-market focus, simple and low tax rate and free flow of information and capital are everything business needs to thrive in Hong Kong, in the Mainland and throughout Asia.\\n\\nIn short, Hong Kong is well equipped to be your strategic partner as you venture into the vast markets of the Belt-Road.\\n\\nIn fact, Hong Kong is already home to more than 600 German companies, more than half of which base their regional operations in Hong Kong.\\n\\nI invite you to join them, to join the world in Hong Kong, your fast lane to the future.\\n\\nMy thanks to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in Berlin and to WirtschaftsWoche for bringing us together this morning.\\n\\nAnd thank you all for taking part in today\\'s business seminar. Thank you.', 'title': 'Transoral laser microsurgery for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer: the Dalhousie University ...', 'media-type': 'News', 'source': '7thSpace', 'published': '2015-09-30T10:23:20Z'}\n",

warm welcome in austria on saturday, under a cold rain, waves of exhausted migrants poured into the border town of nickelsdorf, in austria\\'s burgenland state. austrians waited at the border with hungary to greet the convoys of buses with food and water. one group applauded and let out out welcoming cheers as weary passengers clutching children streamed across the border. the refugees carried their meager belongings in backpacks as they exited the vehicles in the rain. the austrian red cross was also on hand to provide medical supplies and warm blankets. search for a solution the migrant crisis has highlighted disunity in the eu, as member countries have not been able to agree among themselves on how to handle the onslaught of migrants. though eu ministers meeting in luxembourg have not yet agreed on specific policies, they did hammer out some broad general principles for dealing with the crisis: ensure that asylum seekers are protected and treated with basic human rights; fight smugglers and traffickers; strengthen migrants\\' ties to their countries of origin; and work to solve the causes of the influx of refugees -- conflict in syria and in libya. europeans distraught, divided as migrant crisis worsens addressing reporters after saturday\\'s meeting, eu foreign policy chief federica mogherini said europe is finally starting to see the problem for what it is -- not just affecting certain eu states, such as italy and greece, but a europe-wide issue. \"we also have to start using the right words. it is partially a migrant flow, but it is mainly a refugee flow, which puts us in a different situation when it comes to our legal and moral duties,\" she said. it\\'s also a situation that is \"here to stay,\" she warned. the term refugee usually refers to people who have been persecuted politically in their homelands or who are fleeing war. the term migrant is broader and can include people crossing national borders illegally in search of better economic conditions. europe must remember its own history of wars and conflicts, mogherini said, as it considers its responsibility to help and protect refugees. unhcr\\'s fleming said there are a number of things european nations could do to help. \"first of all, once people arrive in europe, what we\\'re proposing is that there be reception centers, registration centers run by the eu, supported by unhcr in greece and italy and also in hungary so that they could claim asylum in those countries,\" she said. \"but it would only work if there is a relocation in place into other countries of europe -- not just germany, not just sweden, not just austria.\" how you can help in the migrant crisis cnn\\'s arwa damon reported from nickelsdorf, while kim hutcherson wrote from atlanta and laura smith-spark from london. cnn\\'s kellie morgan, gul tuysuz, frederik pleitgen, and radina gigova contributed to this report.'}\n",

(yes, there are some running from horrid economic conditions in some countries, but the vast majority are fleeing violence and repression rather than worse welfare.)  the guardian confirmed this fact in a recent article , citing un figures that said that over 60% “of those who had reached europe by boat this year were from syria, eritrea, and afghanistan.” this does not take into account that refugees from other countries, such as libya, iraq, and somalia, have also been running away from war and violence.  the guardian also disputed the idea that the influx of refugees will disrupt the social order in europe, stating that the number of “migrants” that arrived so far in 2015 is 200,000, which “constitutes just 0.027% of europe’s total population.” (statistically speaking, that’s almost one migrant for every 4,000 europeans.)  eu leadership will be needed to counter voices of intolerance emboldened by refugee influx. http://t.co/lzsomioujo  pic.twitter.com/zsvyfpfjhe  — kenneth roth (@kenroth) september 8, 2015  time magazine, however, illustrated how economic issues have played a major role in each european country’s decision in the european refugee crisis. france, for instance, is juggling a hard decision on remaining a human rights leader in the continent and save its economy and reduce the current unemployment rate at the same time. germany, on the other hand, is expecting a decrease in its labor force in the next few decades due to an aging population. more migrant workers would certainly help germany handle this future problem.  #refugeecrisis : new @eu_commission proposals will not solve refugee crisis. #refugeeswelcome  http://t.co/ppefo7quov  pic.twitter.com/lpsqp6oiyl  — amnestyinternational (@amnesty) september 9, 2015  the media has also played a major role in swinging views on the european refugee crisis. earlier on, when news reports and images flooded the media of capsized vessels with hundreds of people drowning, such as this bbc  report , governments were asked to find a humanitarian solution to the european refugee crisis. later, as time went on, some media outlets called on their governments to prevent migrants from entering their country. that all changed when the image of drowned syrian boy alan kurdi went viral, forcing the whole world to take a closer, more humane look at the european refugee crisis. activists and human rights groups became more vocal about the issue and more governments felt more obliged to respond.  exodus to europe is not the solution to refugee crisis or underlying problems. but europe needs to step up short & long term actions  — donald tusk (@eucopresident) september 10, 2015  just today, the guardian reported that thousands of people marched in london to show their support for refugees and calling on world leaders to do more to solve the european refugee crisis.  our country needs you pic.twitter.com/ikprrae9ox  — mark rice-oxley (@markriceoxley69) september 12, 2015  here we go. marching for rights, marching for humanity #refugeeswelcome  pic.twitter.com/ktghjgth1f  — ruta gedmintas (@ruta_gedmintas) september 12, 2015  while opening the doors to the suffering is definitely the most moral solution to the european refugee crisis, the real proper solution is an end to the violence in war torn countries and allowing for more freedom in others. as one telegraph  article put it in its headlines, “how to slow the refugee crisis in europe: stop barrel bombs in syria.”  [photo by ben pruchnie/getty images]  the european refugee crisis: they’re refugees not migrants is an article from: the inquisitr news'}\n",

HIT IN AIR STRIKES', 'media-type': 'News', 'content': 'the air strikes plunged the four-year-old civil war in syria into a volatile new phase as president vladimir putin moved forcefully to assert russian influence in the unstable region. moscow and washington offered conflicting accounts of which targets had been struck, underlining growing tensions between the two former cold war foes over russia\\'s decision to intervene. washington is concerned that moscow is more interested in propping up syrian president bashar al-assad than in beating islamic state. the russian defense ministry said the strikes targeted military equipment, communication facilities, arms depots, ammunition and fuel belonging to islamic state. u.s. officials said targets in the homs area appeared to have been struck, but not areas held by islamic state. russia warned the united states ahead of the strikes to keep its aircraft out of syrian airspace, but the united states pressed forward with its campaign of air strikes against islamic state forces and said it had targeted islamic state near the syrian city of aleppo. a u.s. official said moscow gave washington just an hour\\'s notice of its strikes, which the kremlin said were designed to help assad, its closest regional ally, push back islamist militants. notice of the attack came from a russian official in baghdad who asked the u.s. air force to avoid syrian airspace during the mission, u.s. state department spokesman john kirby said. in moscow, putin said russian air strikes in syria would be limited in scope and that he hoped assad was ready for political reform and a compromise for the sake of his country and people. \"i know that president assad understands that and is ready for such a process. we hope that he will be active and flexible and ready to compromise in the name of his country and his people,\" he told reporters. u.s. secretary of state john kerry said washington would have \"grave concerns\" if russia hit syrian targets where islamic state fighters were not present. speaking at the u.n. security council, kerry also said the militant group, which is also known as isil and isis, \"cannot be defeated as long as bashar al-assad remains president of syria.\" striking homs and opposition groups but not is showed the kremlin\\'s primary aim was to prop up assad, a french diplomatic source said. areas of the province of homs struck by the russians are controlled by an array of rebel groups including several operating under the banner of the \"free syrian army\", activists, locals and rebels said. none of the sources named islamic state as one of the groups operating in the areas hit on wednesday. assad views all the forces opposing him in the civil war as terrorist groups. the homs area is crucial to assad\\'s control of western syria. insurgent control of that area would bisect the assad-held west, separating damascus from the coastal cities of latakia and tartous, where russia operates a naval facility. iyad shamse, leader of an fsa syrian rebel group, the asala and tanmieh front, told reuters: \"there is no islamic state in this area. the russians are applying great pressure on the revolution. this will strengthen terrorism, everyone will head toward extremism. any support for assad in this way is strengthening terrorism.\" he put the death toll from the russian air strikes at 50 civilians, including children. according to a pro-syrian government military source, there were \"five strikes against five areas in syria’s homs.” he said other areas may have been bombed too. proxy war moscow’s intervention means the conflict in syria has been transformed in a few months from a proxy war, in which outside powers were arming and training mostly syrians to fight each other, to an international conflict in which the world’s main military powers except china are directly involved in fighting. that raises the risks of military accidents between outside powers and raises pressure for a diplomatic solution, without making it any easier. russia joined the united states and its arab allies, turkey, france, iran and israel in direct intervention, with britain expected to join soon, if it gets parliamentary approval. russian jets went into action after the upper house of the russian parliament gave putin unanimous backing for strikes following a request for military assistance from assad. in a barely concealed jibe at washington, a spokesman for putin said later the vote meant moscow would be practically the only country in syria to be conducting operations \"on a legitimate basis\" and at the request of \"the legitimate president of syria\". the last time the russian parliament granted putin the right to use military force abroad, a technical requirement under russian law, moscow seized crimea from ukraine last year. putin said russia\\'s military involvement in the middle east would involve only its air force and would be temporary. one of the reasons for getting involved was the need to stop russian citizens who had joined the ranks of islamic state from later returning home to cause trouble, he said. a u.s.-led coalition has already been bombing islamic state in iraq and syria. but putin derided u.s. efforts on monday in a speech at the united nations, suggesting a broader and more coordinated coalition was needed to defeat the militants. \"the military aim of our operations will be exclusively to provide air support to syrian government forces in their struggle against isis (islamic state),\" sergei ivanov, the kremlin\\'s chief-of-staff, said before reports that the strikes had begun. russia has been steadily dispatching more and more military aircraft to a base in latakia, regarded as an assad stronghold, after the syrian government suffered a series of battlefield reverses. moscow has already sent military experts to a recently established command center in baghdad which is coordinating air strikes and ground troops in syria, a russian official told reuters. russia\\'s involvement in syria will be a further challenge for moscow, which is already intervening in ukraine at a time when its own economy is suffering from low oil prices and western sanctions.'}\n",

'russian forces have begun participating in military operations in syria in support of government troops, three lebanese sources familiar with the political and military situation there said on wednesday. the sources, speaking to reuters on condition they not be identified, gave the most forthright account yet from the region of what the united states fears is a deepening russian military role in syria\\'s civil war, though one of the lebanese sources said the number of russians involved so far was small. u.s. officials said russia sent two tank landing ships and additional cargo aircraft to syria in the past day or so and deployed a small number of naval infantry forces. the u.s. officials, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, said the intent of russia\\'s military moves in syria was unclear. one suggested the focus may be on preparing an airfield near the port city of latakia, a stronghold of syrian president bashar al-assad. u.s. officials have not ruled out the possibility that russia may want to use the airfield for air combat missions. u.s. secretary of state john kerry spoke to his russian counterpart for the second time in four days to express concern over reports of russian military activities in syria, warning that it could fan more violence. the white house said it was closely monitoring the situation. russia says the syrian government must be incorporated into a shared global fight against islamic state, the islamist group that has taken over large parts of syria and iraq. the united states and assad\\'s regional foes see him as part of the problem. \"we would welcome constructive russian contributions to the counter-isil effort, but we\\'ve been clear that it would be unconscionable for any party, including the russians, to provide any support to the assad regime,\" white house spokesman eric schultz said, using an acronym for islamic state. syrian troops pulling back assad\\'s forces have faced big setbacks on the battlefield in a four-year-old multi-sided civil war that has killed 250,000 people and driven half of syria\\'s 23 million people from their homes. syrian troops pulled out of a major air base last wednesday, and a monitoring group said this meant government soldiers were no longer present at all in idlib province, most of which slipped from government control earlier this year. moscow confirmed it had \"experts\" on the ground in syria, its long-time ally in the middle east.  but russia has declined to comment on the scale and scope of its military presence. damascus denied russians were involved in combat, but a syrian official said the presence of experts had increased in the past year. reflecting western concern, germany\\'s foreign minister warned russia against increased military intervention, saying the iran nuclear deal and new u.n. initiatives offered a starting point for a political solution to the conflict. nato secretary general jens stoltenberg said reports of growing russian military activity in syria were a cause for concern, while france said it made finding a political solution to the crisis more complicated. two of the lebanese sources said the russians were establishing two bases in syria, one near the coast and one further inland which would be an operations base. \"the russians are no longer just advisors,\" one of the sources said. \"the russians have decided to join the war against terrorism.\" russian naval base  moscow\\'s only naval base in the mediterranean is at tartous on the syrian coast in territory held by assad, and keeping it secure would be an important strategic objective for the kremlin. another of the lebanese sources said that so far any russian combat role was still small: \"they have started in small numbers, but the bigger force did not yet take part ... there are numbers of russians taking part in syria but they did not yet join the fight against terrorism strongly.\" the syrian official said: \"russian experts are always present but in the last year they have been present to a greater degree.\" officials in the united states, which is fighting an air war against the islamist militant group islamic state in syria and also opposes assad\\'s government, have said in recent days that they suspect russia is reinforcing to aid assad. washington has put pressure on countries nearby to deny their air space to russian flights, a move moscow denounced on wednesday as \"international boorishness\". russia has set out the case for supporting assad in the most forthright terms yet in the past few days, likening the western approach to syria to failures in iraq and libya. part of the diplomatic quarrel has centered around use of air space for flights, which moscow says bring humanitarian aid but u.s. officials say may be bringing military supplies.  u.s. officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, told reuters on wednesday that multiple russian flights have passed over the airspace of iran and iraq to reach syria. russian overflights the state department said russian use of iranian airspace would not be surprising, given tehran\\'s past support for assad. spokesman john kirby said the united states had advised \"partners and our friends to ask the russians tough questions about\" overflight requests. he did not elaborate, saying only: \"i’m not gonna detail diplomatic conversations.\" to avoid flying over turkey, one of assad\\'s main enemies, russia has sought to fly planes over balkan states, but washington has urged them to deny moscow permission. on tuesday, bulgaria refused a russian request to use its airspace citing doubts about the cargo on board. it said on wednesday it would allow russian supply flights to syria to use its airspace only if moscow agreed to checks of their cargo at a bulgarian airport. turkey has not officially confirmed a ban on russian flights to syria but says it considers any requests to fly over its air space to syria on a case by case basis. thus far in the war, iran and its lebanese ally hezbollah have been assad\\'s main sources of military support. the momentum turned against assad earlier this year. in the latest setback, state television reported government troops had surrendered an air base in northwestern syria to a rebel alliance after nearly two years under siege. this meant the last government troops had withdrawn from central idlib province, according to the syrian observatory for human rights, a uk-based group that monitors the conflict.

(photo: courtesy photo) when ryan hollow visited nepal in 2012, he was struck by how much the friendliness of the locals reminded him of the culture in montana’s small mountain towns. “everyone you meet stops and says hello,” said hollow, who grew in great falls. “i’ve felt that same kind of camaraderie and kinship in east glacier and red lodge.” hollow was devastated by the news of the earthquake that hit nepal in april, killing more than 9,000 people. “i can’t even describe the feeling,” hollow said of hearing about the quake. “just the scale of it.” hollow wanted to give money to the relief cause but had a hard time finding an organization to which he felt confident donating. so instead, hollow decided to organize a trip to nepal and bring his donation in person. even before the earthquake, hollow knew he wanted to return to nepal. however, the natural disaster inspired him to plan more than just a climbing trip. “we just had such good support, such good generosity when we were there,” hollow said. “we wanted to do something more.” in october, hollow will return to nepal with two friends from east glacier, one from big sky and his girlfriend, who lives in choteau. they’ll be climbing ama dablam, a 22,349-foot-tall mountain in the himalaya region of eastern nepal. along the way, at each village, the climbers will stop and distribute jackets, hats and gloves to children. black diamond has agreed to sell the items at cost to the climbers. the group started a crowdsourcing fundraising campaign to raise money to buy the winter clothing. “himalayan winter is setting in, villagers are battling food and clean water shortages and are without adequate permanent homes and shelter,” hollow explains on the indiegogo fundraising website. “throughout the khumbu the rebuilding process is underway, it will be a long hard road, and basic survival items are in dire need for the people of nepal.” a young boy tries on ryan hollow’s backpack during his last trip to nepal in 2012. \\xa0 (photo: photo courtesy of ryan hollow) the campaign was launched about a week ago and with $900 already raised, the group is more than halfway to its $1,500 goal. “i just have been overwhelmed by people’s generosity,” hollow said. hollow’s last trip to nepal took him to the annapurna region where he climbed 23,375-foot himlung himal. this time he’ll be traveling to the khumbu region, which is home to mount everest and is one of the most visited areas of nepal. “it was also the hardest hit,” hollow said. “it damaged a lot of really famous monasteries. they’re rebuilding it.” during the trek, hollow and his fellow climbers will carry the jackets and other gear themselves, which will allow them to bring more supplies than if porters were carrying everything. “we commit to bringing as much free gear as we can afford to fly or ship to kathmandu,” hollow wrote. “our expedition team will carry the loads alongside our porters en route to basecamp.” during his last trip, hollow was embarrassed that young men and women were carrying his gear for his trek. “when we made friends with them along the trail they told us they are very proud to have these jobs, and they bring home more money than their parents by ... portaging gear,” hollow wrote. “now being able to carry loads full of gifts for the people in the khumbu i feel very fortunate.” after the group returns to montana, they plan to host slideshows to share what they saw and learned in nepal, “just to get people interested in another mountain culture,” hollow explained. he hopes to hold presentations at outdoor organizations and local schools. while in nepal, hollow will be posting photos and stories to facebook, so people can follow along on his journey. his guides tell him he’ll have 3g cell service for the entire trek. cell service is used on the mountain for emergency communication. to donate, visit life.indiegogo.com/fundraisers/nepal-earthquake-relief-khumbu-region--2 . to follow along on the journey, visit rockymtnry.blogspot.com or follow ryan hollow on facebook. contact him on facebook to arrange a presentation after he returns. read or share this story: http://gftrib.com/1uu'}\n",

(read: nepal ice doctors risk all for sole everest hopeful )  \"i decide to descend,\" he posted on his official facebook page in the early hours of sunday.  \"i tried hard taking all my energy, but it took too much time to move in deep deep snow. i realized if i kept going, i wouldn\\'t be able to come back alive, so i decided to descend.  \"thank you so much for all your support. i appreciate you all from bottom of my heart.\"  without the aid of bottled oxygen, a determined kuriki had planned to tackle the final stretch alone overnight, ascending into the \"death zone\" – located above 8,000 meters, notorious for its difficult terrain and thin air.  the risks are higher than usual thanks to regular aftershocks increasing the chance of avalanches, while mountaineering experts say climbing in the autumn is more dangerous than spring due to high winds and lower temperatures.  mountaineers usually begin their summit attempts late at night, which allows them to descend in daylight, lowering the risk of them falling to their deaths due to exhaustion.  kuriki had originally planned to summit in mid-september before bad weather forced him to delay.  mountaineering is a major revenue-earner for impoverished nepal, home to eight of the world\\'s 14 peaks over 8,000 meters.  the april 25 earthquake killed nearly 8,900 people in the himalayan nation. apart from the everest avalanche it destroyed the popular langtang trekking route, raising fears for the immediate future of the tourism industry.  kuriki has previously said he wanted to help nepal.  \"everest has seen tragedies in the last two years, and i want to help nepal revive its tourism,\" he said. - rappler.com'}\n",

the country’s third.  a presidency source said tsipras would be sworn in on monday afternoon. initially, negotiating debt relief will dominate his agenda, a senior syriza source said.  “we will continue negotiations in the coming period, with the debt issue being the first and most important battle,” the party source said. “we will ask all political forces to support our efforts.”  tsipras - along with most greek political leaders and many international economists - argues that the country cannot recover from years of crisis without easing its huge debt burden.  in his victory speech to cheering athens crowds late on sunday, tsipras promised a new phase of stability in a country that has held five general elections in six years but did not mention the €86 billion euro bailout.  however, syriza campaigned on a pledge to implement the programme, which includes more tax rises and pensions cuts, while promising to introduce measures to protect vulnerable groups.  with the first review of the bailout programme due next month, tsipras must work fast to oversee a recapitalisation of the country’s banks - closed for three weeks at the height of the summer crisis and still subject to capital controls - while trying to stave off a recession and tackling the migrant crisis.  his first international summit is on wednesday in brussels to discuss the hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants pouring into europe , many via greek islands that border turkey .  in a reminder of that crisis, 13 migrants died in turkish waters on sunday when a boat carrying 46 people en route to greece collided with a cargo vessel and capsized, a turkish coast guard source said.  emboldened  in a financial market that looked to have factored in a syriza win, greek shares lost ground on monday and government bond yields edged higher - mirroring a generally cautious reaction elsewhere to tsipras’s second incarnation as leader.  european council president donald tusk said many of the biggest problems facing the european union were the same as greece’s - the refugee crisis and creating economic growth and jobs. “i trust that greece, with your new government will contribute constructively in seeking solutions to all those challenges,” he said in a letter to tsipras.  tsipras plans to form a national council for european policy, including representatives of parties other than syriza and the independent greeks and which would advise the finance minister, the syriza source said.  centre-left daily newspaper ethnos on monday tipped euclid tsakalotos, the former finance minister who brokered terms of the bailout accord in august, to be re-appointed.  citigroup economist giada giani said the risk remained that greece - having flirted with grexit during fraught bailout negotiations in the spring and early summer - might still leave the euro zone.  jp morgan analyst malcolm barr said tsipras was likely to feel emboldened by the election result, which “provides a platform upon which syriza will continue to challenge significant parts of the (bailout) programme”.  some form of restructuring of greece’s euro zone debt should be in place by the end of march, he wrote in a note.  some european governments, particularly germany, are opposed to writing off part of greece’s debt - a so-called haircut - but not averse to stretching out its repayment schedule.  ralph brinkhaus, a senior parliamentary ally of german chancellor angela merkel, urged tsipras to stick to the reform agenda and implement the bailout measures.  euro zone officials told reuters last week that governments are ready to cap greece’s annual debt-servicing costs at 15 percent of its economic output over the long term. that would mean the nominal payment would be lower if the greek economy struggled, higher if it was more robust, they said.  reuters'}\n",

TECHNOCRATS–4 � FRANCIS KWARTENG', 'media-type': 'News', 'content': 'this article continues the discussion on the orwellian hypocrisy of capitalists, a piece which contributes to the negative role capitalism plays in financial crisis around the world. it seems an irony of unimaginable proportion when hypocritical free-market fundamentalists do not allow free-market mechanism to work when it stands in the way of the “mentality of profit,” to borrow pope francis’ phraseology. these shameless free-market fundamentalists publicly preach free market to themselves and to the rest of the world but go all the way out to behave otherwise in the halls of secrecy.these wall street free-market fundamentalist technocrats are the first to go to government for financial bailout in times of crisis, the first to lobby against regulations that improve the environment for the smooth operationalization of market mechanism, and the first to help other capitalists to cheat the system (title of the piece is “wall st. helped to mask debt fueling europe’s crisis.” authors: louis story, nelson d. schwartz, and landon thomas, jr. feb. 13, 2013). that is, they know the concept of free-market mechanism can grossly undermine a tendency toward profit generation in many a situation. thus they throw the concept to the dogs when doing so actually preserves their humungous profit margins. read on:“wall street tactics akin to the ones that fostered subprime mortgages in america have worsened the financial crisis shaking greece and undermining the euro by enabling european governments to hide their mounting debts.“as worries over greece rattle world markets, records and interviews show that with wall street’s help, the nation engaged in a decade-long effort to skirt european debt limits. one deal created by goldman sachs helped obscure billions in debt from the budget overseers in brussels.“even as the crisis was nearing the flashpoint, banks were searching for ways to help greece forestall the day of reckoning. in early november—three months before athens became the epicenter of global financial anxiety—a team from goldman sachs arrived in the ancient city with a very modern proposition for a government struggling to pay its bills, according to two people who were briefed on the meeting.“the bankers, led by goldman’s president, gary d. cohn, held out a financing instrument that would have pushed debt from greece’s health care system far into the future, much as when strapped homeowners take out second mortgages to pay off their credit cards.“it had worked before. in 2001, just after greece was admitted to europe’s monetary union, goldman helped the government quietly borrow billions, people familiar with the transaction said. that deal, hidden from public view because it was treated as a currency trade rather than a loan, helped athens to meet europe’s deficit rules while continuing to spend beyond its means.“athens did not pursue the latest goldman proposal, but with greece groaning under the weight of its debts and with its richer neighbors vowing to come to its aid, the deals over the last decade are raising questions about wall street’s role in the world’s latest financial drama.“as in the american subprime crisis and the implosion of the american international group, financial derivatives played a role in the run-up of greek debt. instruments developed by goldman sachs, jpmorgan chase and a wide range of other banks enabled politicians to mask additional borrowing in greece, italy and possibly elsewhere.“in dozens of deals across the continent, banks provided cash upfront in return for government payments in the future, with those liabilities then left off the books. greece, for example, traded away the rights to airport fees and lottery proceeds in years to come.“critics say that such deals, because they are not recorded as loans, mislead investors and regulators about the depth of a country’s liabilities.“some of the greek deals were named after figures in greek mythology. one of them, for instance, was called aeolos, after the god of the winds.“the crisis in greece poses the most significant challenge yet to europe’s common currency, the euro, and the continent’s goal of economic unity. the country is, in the argot of banking, too big to be allowed to fail. greece owes the world $300 billion, and major banks are on the hook for much of that debt. a default would reverberate around the globe.“a spokeswoman for the greek finance ministry said the government had met with many banks in recent months and had not committed to any bank’s offers. all debt financings “are conducted in an effort of transparency,” she said. goldman and jpmorgan declined to comment.“while wall street’s handiwork in europe has received little attention on this side of the atlantic, it has been sharply criticized in greece and in magazines like der spiegel in germany.“politicians want to pass the ball forward, and if a banker can show them a way to pass a problem to the future, they will fall for it,” said gikas a. hardouvelis, an economist and former government official who helped write a recent report on greece’s accounting policies.“wall street did not create europe’s debt problem. but bankers enabled greece and others to borrow beyond their means, in deals that were perfectly legal. few rules govern how nations can borrow the money they need for expenses like the military and health care. the market for sovereign debt—the wall street term for loans to governments—is as unfettered as it is vast.“if a government wants to cheat, it can cheat,” said garry schinasi, a veteran of the international monetary fund’s capital markets surveillance unit, which monitors vulnerability in global capital markets.“banks eagerly exploited what was, for them, a highly lucrative symbiosis with free-spending governments. while greece did not take advantage of goldman’s proposal in november 2009, it had paid the bank about $300 million in fees for arranging the 2001 transaction, according to several bankers familiar with the deal.“such derivatives, which are not openly documented or disclosed, add to the uncertainty over how deep the troubles go in greece and which other governments might have used similar off-balance sheet accounting.“the tide of fear is now washing over other economically troubled countries on the periphery of europe, making it more expensive for italy, spain and portugal to borrow.“for all the benefits of uniting europe with one currency, the birth of the euro came with an original sin: countries like italy and greece entered the monetary union with bigger deficits than the ones permitted under the treaty that created the currency. rather than raise taxes or reduce spending, however, these governments artificially reduced their deficits with derivatives.“derivatives do not have to be sinister. the 2001 transaction involved a type of derivative known as a swap. one such instrument, called an interest-rate swap, can help companies and countries cope with swings in their borrowing costs by exchanging fixed-rate payments for floating-rate ones, or vice versa. another kind, a currency swap, can minimize the impact of volatile foreign exchange rates.“but with the help of jpmorgan, italy was able to do more than that. despite persistently high deficits, a 1996 derivative helped bring italy’s budget into line by swapping currency with jpmorgan at a favorable exchange rate, effectively putting more money in the government’s hands. in return, italy committed to future payments that were not booked as liabilities.“derivatives are a very useful instrument,” said gustavo piga, an economics professor who wrote a report for the council on foreign relations on the italian transaction. “they just become bad if they’re used to window-dress accounts.”“in greece, the financial wizardry went even further. in what amounted to a garage sale on a national scale, greek officials essentially mortgaged the country’s airports and highways to raise much-needed money.“aeolos, a legal entity created in 2001, helped greece reduce the debt on its balance sheet that year. as part of the deal, greece got cash upfront in return for pledging future landing fees at the country’s airports. a similar deal in 2000 called ariadne devoured the revenue that the government collected from its national lottery. greece, however, classified those transactions as sales, not loans, despite doubts by many critics.“these kinds of deals have been controversial within government circles for years. as far back as 2000, european finance ministers fiercely debated whether derivative deals used for creative accounting should be disclosed.“the answer was no. but in 2002, accounting disclosure was required for many entities like aeolos and ariadne that did not appear on nations’ balance sheets, prompting governments to restate such deals as loans rather than sales.“still, as recently as 2008, eurostat, the european union’s statistics agency, reported that “in a number of instances, the observed securitization operations seem to have been purportedly designed to achieve a given accounting result, irrespective of the economic merit of the operation.”“while such accounting gimmicks may be beneficial in the short run, over time they can prove disastrous.“george alogoskoufis, who became greece’s finance minister in a political party shift after the goldman deal, criticized the transaction in the parliament in 2005. the deal, mr. alogoskoufis argued, would saddle the government with big payments to goldman until 2019.“mr. alogoskoufis, who stepped down a year ago, said in an e-mail message last week that goldman later agreed to reconfigure the deal “to restore its good will with the republic.” he said the new design was better for greece than the old one.“in 2005, goldman sold the interest rate swap to the national bank of greece, the country’s largest bank, according to two people briefed on the transaction.“in 2008, goldman helped the bank put the swap into a legal entity called titlos. but the bank retained the bonds that titlos issued, according to dealogic, a financial research firm, for use as collateral to borrow even more from the european central bank.“edward manchester, a senior vice president at the moody’s credit rating agency, said the deal would ultimately be a money-loser for greece because of its long-term payment obligations.“referring to the titlos swap with the government of greece, he said: “this swap is always going to be unprofitable for the greek government.”source:http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/business/global/14debt.html?pagewanted=all&_r=0more feature article »

SCIOLISM1 IN AN ERA OF SPECIALIZATION', 'media-type': 'Blog', 'content': 'by thanos catsambas*  with the third bailout program in five years approved by eurozone countries on august 20, 2015 to help greece avoid bankruptcy and an inevitable disorderly exit from the eurozone, one can reasonably wonder, “what will be different this time?” without a dramatic change in greece’s political decision-making, the answer is “nothing,” because the greek political system is run by sciolist decision-makers supported by media that continue to feed myths and misinformation about the origin, developments and possible resolution of the greek economic crisis. while the greek crisis was triggered by the inability of the government to meet its obligations on international bonds in 2010, it was caused by long-standing structural weaknesses and the gradual loss of competiveness in the areas of textiles, light manufacturing, shipping repairs, and even an array of agricultural products and fisheries. the decline in greece’s competitiveness was, in turn, due to the inability of the country to respond effectively to globalization, and find alternative comparative advantages in the new global division of labor. this much is well understood and accepted by serious analysts. but what followed in the five years after the outbreak of the crisis is a testimonial to how difficult it is, even for credible international commentators, to analyze an economy from a distance, without sufficient knowledge of the internal workings and true constraints of the economy in question. in my view, the greek crisis has been frequently analyzed without due regard to two major factors: first, the rigid financing constraints faced by greece as soon as it lost access to private capital markets; second, the multiple structural rigidities and distortions in greece, which would be inconceivable in an advanced capitalist economy2 . in this commentary, i shall highlight the most pervasive myths that have accompanied the first five years of the greek crisis, offer an explanation of their persistence and 1 sciolism: the superficial display of knowledge and learning 2 a comprehensive analytical article that sets the record straight on many misconceptions is hanswerner sinn, “the greek tragedy”, cesifo forum, special issue, june 2015. page 2 of 8 conclude with what i believe is the only potentially viable solution. my analysis is a narrative about “myths”, not only because of greece’s preeminent position in international mythology, but, more importantly, because of the decisive role they played in impeding progress and helping political parties with obsolete economic concepts gain and maintain power in greek society. myth i: there were painless alternatives to the adjustment path that greece had to follow in 2010. this myth has been a recurring theme of many domestic and international debates since 2010 and has been the archetypal myth promulgated by syriza (both when it was in the opposition, and after it became the main party of the coalition that formed a new government in january 2015). before its complete capitulation at the july 17 eurozone summit, the present greek government argued formally and informally that austerity was the cause of the crisis and that it must end. the reality, of course, is the reverse: the latent crisis in the years preceding 2010 was the cause of the subsequent austerity, because any economy that reaches the point of default must go through a period of adjustment to stabilize its faltering macroeconomic imbalances. simply stated, a country that has been living beyond its means for decades, and for which the day of judgment has arrived, must go through a period of fiscal consolidation with a decline in its standard of living. this simple truth was never explained in straightforward terms by any responsible decision maker, and reflects one of the biggest failures of the papandreou, papademos and samaras governments in terms of their respective communication policies. there was never an attempt to explain the implications of the point that greece had reached by the end of 2009, why the country had reached that point, where the country wanted to go in the future, and what was the (necessary and one-way) path that it would have to follow to achieve its future objectives. part of the blame must be attributed to the international partners (the former “troika”), who also spoke in obscure terms (“internal devaluation” etc.) instead of simplifying the issue. the greek people were led to believe that their government had the power to page 3 of 8 relieve them of the austerity measures, if only it could negotiate more effectively with its international partners. in fact, the only area where the government could and should have exercised control was to ensure a fair distribution of the burden of adjustment among its citizens. but there was no other option. once a country has gone bankrupt, as greece did in 2010, the standard of living that its citizens had enjoyed thanks to abundant and cheap borrowing from capital markets until then, must decline to a level compatible with the productive capacity of the country and its ability to repay its debts. myth ii: the troika-supported program failed. an extensive misinformation campaign, especially perpetuated by the greek media, has focused on the axiom that the program “failed”. there is little doubt that what commentators have in mind when they speak about “failure” is the decline in gdp, the rise in unemployment, the closing of several small businesses, the decline in property values and, more generally, the decline in the standard of living of the greek population compared to what it was before 2010. but this interpretation reflects precisely the failure of greek authorities to explain that a retrenchment was unavoidable and that the purpose of the program was to reset the economy on new, modern pillars that would ensure longterm viable growth. the myth of the program failure is also linked with the assertion that bailout programs caused the serious austerity that the greek economy experienced in the past five years. the traditional argument against a fund-supported program fails to realize that austerity would have been more severe without a program3 . the reason is that a country that essentially has gone bankrupt (and cannot tap capital markets anymore) will have to adjust its expenditures to available resources, which, in the absence of loans, will be only available domestic revenues, notably tax collections. in a collapsing economy with declining revenues there is no way that a government can finance the earlier level of expenditures. in the case of greece, the 2009 budget deficit was 15.6% of gdp, or about 3 an interesting article that analyzes this question in some depth is daniel gros, “the greek austerity myth”, project syndicate, february 10, 2015. page 4 of 8 €32 billion. without the may 2010 loan from the then troika, greece would have had to reduce its spending by €32 billion immediately. instead, greece received the biggest loan in the history of the imf and of the eurozone (the first at the time), in the amount of €110 billion, which helped smooth out the adjustment process. moreover, two years later, in 2012, greece was granted the highest sovereign debt haircut in recorded world history, equivalent to 53% of nominal debt. both the loan and the debt operation definitely helped greece begin the adjustment at a much milder pace than it would have been possible without them. objectively speaking, one can argue that one part of the adjustment program fully succeeded while the other part succeeded only to a limited extent. the part of the program for which the imf was primarily responsible, i.e. the fiscal adjustment, not only did not fail, but in fact was very successful, as a primary surplus of 0.8% of gdp was achieved one year earlier than programmed, namely in 2013 instead of 2014. and the fiscal adjustment was also “progressive”, because most of the burden fell on the higher salary and pension earners. the program, however, was not successful in terms of unleashing the productive capacity of the economy, because most of the mandated structural reforms were either not implemented or were implemented only partially or ineffectively. the european commission, which was primarily responsible for the structural aspects of the program, was partly to blame, because it imposed too many requirements in too short a time, without taking into account the administrative capacity of the country: in other words, the problem with implementation was not so much a question of political will, as it was an issue of capability—at least until the middle of 2014. myth iii: public expenditures in an economy under financial distress can always be set according to national priorities. one of the major weaknesses in the reasoning of many greek politicians and even academic economists is that they do not understand the importance of below-the-line accounts in the budget, namely the constraints imposed by available financing. elementary economic theory (especially keynesian theory) essentially assumes that there page 5 of 8 are no financing constraints and that movements in output and employment can be influenced by government intervention. under normal circumstances, a government would submit to parliament a budget whose expenditures would be determined by projected revenues and whatever deficit would be estimated to be compatible with debt sustainability over the medium term. the deficit would then be financed by private capital markets—domestic or international. but when a country is facing severe financing constraints (e.g. has gone bankrupt, like greece), external financing is not available through the capital markets and is only provided by international official creditors. under these circumstances, the government can only fulfill national priorities to the extent such funds are available. public expenditures are a residual and are determined by domestic revenues and available official financing; in other words, while they can be prioritized, their total amount cannot be increased at the discretion of the government. this is a reality check that the current greek government was unprepared to accept, and as late as june 2015 it decided to default on its obligations to the imf, rather than reduce its expenditures. if decision makers do not respect this simple arithmetic calculation and continue to retain (on paper) fictional obligations regardless of the financing constraints, then the economy moves into the realm of domestic arrears, where in reality employees and companies do not get paid. there are numerous receivables and payables on all sides and eventually the domestic economy is full of arrears from one economic agent to another, which results in a very messy situation that may take years to unwind. that was indeed the situation in the new cis countries (the republics of the former soviet union), after the collapse of the latter in the early 1990s. myth iv: the political cost impaired the implementation of reforms for many years, analysts of the greek economy and its travails have argued that the deterioration and eventual collapse of the greek economy was due to government policies that ignored technocratic constraints, and that necessary “tough” decisions where delayed or never taken due to the proverbial “political cost”. page 6 of 8 this analysis is partially correct. political considerations were (and shall always be) present in a representative democracy, but the case of greece transcends pure politics and descends to lack of competence by both politicians and civil servants alike. the months following the february 25, 2015 agreement, which extended the european program until june 30, 2015, were a surrealistic experience for all those involved in the negotiations between the new syriza government and greece’s creditors. as a sign of respect to the outcome of the january elections, the creditors accepted a series of childish requests by the greek government, notably the change of the term “troika” to “institutions” and the shifting of the locus of negotiations from athens to brussels (hence the name brussels group). the imf has rarely accepted the conduct of discussions with authorities outside the capital city and normally only for reasons of security. the conduct of discussions outside a country’s capital is not explicitly disallowed by the fund’s articles of agreement, but it is clearly a very inefficient process—as was shown in practice by many incidents during the greek negotiations, for example, rotating counterparts, incomplete information, changing positions, and, at the end of the day, lack of authority by the greek officials to negotiate in good faith. by the end of april, the imf, the ecb, the european commission and the us government (the latter had played an increasingly important role in the resolution of the greek crisis behind the scenes) had all concluded that the greek side was so inexperienced and ignorant about fundamental concepts of macroeconomic management, that further negotiations in good faith would be a waste of time. therefore, they decided to present the greek authorities with “take it or leave it” proposals, albeit in the beginning gradually and in a measured pace. as a result of this process, the greek government capitulated at the july 12 summit of eurozone leaders after a 17-hour acrimonious session with prime minister tsipras. the summit statement, which began with an unorthodox sentence about the “crucial need to rebuild trust” between greece and its partners, included every point that the greek government had sought to avoid until then, and in addition made a direct reference against the possibility of a nominal haircut of greece’s sovereign debt—a point the greek government had desperately attempted to include. in short, greece lost on both inclusions and omissions in the statement. the new memorandum of understanding, signed between greece and its creditors three weeks later and approved by the eurogroup on august 14, was a more detailed version of the summit statement. page 7 of 8 conclusion and recommendation after six months of interactions between the new greek government and the country’s creditors, which the authorities had triumphantly called “negotiations leading to an honest compromise,” greece finds itself at square one: continued fiscal adjustment, further austerity and reforms, more supervision by the creditors (e.g. in the area of privatizations), stricter banking and npl rules, and still unclear prospects about the extent and nature of the much-sought debt restructuring. what, then, did the syriza government accomplish? sadly, the syriza government succeeded only in convincing the european partners and the imf that the fundamental problem with the greek political landscape, particularly as reflected since january 2015, was not political choices but, simply, incompetence and disrespect for international rules. part of that conclusion transcends the present government. surely, the decision makers of syriza (who, it is now revealed, were surrounded by inexperienced, ineffective, and well-paid “international advisors”) showed an amazing unfamiliarity with applied macroeconomics while promulgating advanced theoretical concepts coupled with a contempt for down-to-earth arithmetic. but the opposition parties and the notoriously inept greek media (gratefully with a handful of exceptions) demonstrated an equal detachment from common sense. where do recent developments leave greece and what are its prospects for steady and sustainable growth? in the first paragraph of this analysis, i indicated that nothing will be different this time unless a dramatic change takes place in greece’s decision-making process. it is now time for me to define what i mean by “dramatic change.” i call for a two-pronged, concurrent approach: first, a government based on the broadest possible coalition, with an economic team comprising internationally recognized specialists (economists, businessmen, lawyers, tax accountants and privatization experts); second, a government granted legislative authority, which would enable it to decree laws with only broad parliamentary supervision until the end of the bailout program. such extraordinary powers appear necessary to by-pass bureaucratic hurdles and parliamentary roadblocks during a period that timely decisions and implementation would be of the essence. the stabilization, fiscal consolidation, and banking recapitalization aspects of the program would need to be a complemented by a conscious effort (in the form of a dedicated task page 8 of 8 force) to identify the new comparative advantages of greece in the global division of labor and help advance a new mindset that will attract international investors and nurture domestic enterprises. in my view, this radical strategy is a necessary condition for greece to remain in the eurozone. the upcoming general elections are the last hope for the implementation of such a strategy. ******************************************************************** * thanos catsambas, a yale ph.d. in economics, is a

YORK TIMES', 'media-type': 'News', 'content': 'havana — revolution square is the political stage of revolutionary cuba. fidel castro held huge rallies here to castigate the imperialists up north. looming over the square are immense portraits of the revolutionaries che guevara and camilo cienfuegos.  into this charged atmosphere on sunday came pope francis, celebrating an outdoor mass attended by president raúl castro, the leadership of his communist government and tens of thousands of cuban people. for those hoping francis would speak about political freedom during his visit to cuba, the moment seemed ripe.  and francis did speak about politics. colombian politics. he encouraged that country’s peace talks.  as for cuban politics, francis has so far spoken in what might be called pope code. at the plaza and other events on sunday, as he did at the airport welcoming ceremony the day before, francis refrained from any direct criticisms of the cuban government but made the sort of oblique asides that could be interpreted as disapproval — or explained away as anything but.  “service is never ideological,” francis said at the plaza soaked in ideology, after summoning cubans to embrace the christian ideal of service, “for we do not serve ideas. we serve people.”  in visiting cuba, francis is following his predecessors — both pope john paul ii and pope benedict xvi held mass in revolution square — and charting a new path. as the first latin-american pope, francis is enormously influential in his native region, which has raised expectations and pressures that he will wade into regional politics. his role in brokering the diplomatic breakthrough between cuba and the united states has only raised his credibility.  yet he is careful to avoid seeming too political and is being especially careful in navigating the politics of cuba. this cautiousness has frustrated some cuban dissidents who want a public meeting with the pope. on sunday, the police stopped three men trying to distribute leaflets near revolution square.  “i wouldn’t say we are disappointed — it simply doesn’t appear to us to be right or just that the pope doesn’t have a little time to meet with those cubans who are defending human rights,” said josé daniel ferrer, the head of nation’s largest dissident organization, the patriotic union of cuba.  mr. daniel said that more than 60 people had been arrested before and during the pope’s visit, including three prominent female activists who were in contact with the pope’s delegation. but he noted that the detentions had been conducted carefully, a sign of the changing times.  francis has dipped into some issues in latin america, and avoided getting directly involved in others in the region. during his visit to south america in july, francis endorsed dialogue between bolivia and chile over landlocked bolivia’s demands for an access route to the sea. he gave prominence on sunday to the colombia peace talks — though the vatican has rejected calls to directly intervene in the negotiations between the government and the farc rebel group. francis has also resisted requests that he support argentina’s claims on the falkland islands.  “there has never been such resonance for the papacy in latin america,” said gianni la bella, an expert in rome on latin-american catholicism. “you could almost say that francis is considered as an alternate united nations in the region.”  for many cubans, those living on the island as well as the diaspora, the role of the pope is more than merely spiritual. as an argentine, francis lived through dictatorship and the political turmoil that ensued, giving him more than just a linguistic and historical affinity for the people of cuba, said hugo cancio, a cuban-american businessman.      multimedia feature | francis in america latest news and features on pope francis’ visit to washington, new york and philadelphia in september.    “he is one of us, in many ways,” mr. cancio said. “he understands the desires of cubans.”  he added: “his message cannot be spiritual alone — there has to be some political component. but he is doing it in a soft and careful way.”  the welcoming ceremony on saturday offered a small example of this balancing act. first, francis thanked president castro and conveyed his respects to fidel castro. then, in a nod to dissidents and the diaspora, he added that he “would like my greeting to embrace especially all those who, for various reasons, i will not be able to meet, and to cubans throughout the world.”  after the mass on sunday, francis met for more than a half-hour with fidel castro and members of his family for what the vatican spokesman described as an informal and familial chat. the two men exchanged books, as francis recalled that the former cuban leader had asked for reading materials during pope benedict’s visit in 2012.  francis also had a private meeting with president castro at the palace of revolution, though neither man made any public remarks.  once heavily catholic, cuba has long mattered to the vatican, just as cuba has long influenced south america. during the 1970s, fidel castro and other cuban revolutionaries helped inspire and train the guerrilla movements in argentina and elsewhere across the continent. more recently, populist leftist leaders in venezuela, ecuador and bolivia have embraced cuba and the castro political legacy.  mr. la bella, the analyst, said that francis did not endorse the politics of those leftist leaders but that he recognized they have tapped into a sentiment shared by many people across latin america.  “francis wants to connect with that hope for change that these movements express,” mr. la bella said. “for francis, cuba is a strategic front line for the new relationship with south american countries.”  in his speeches, francis has at times sought to help steer cuba in a new direction at a moment when many analysts expect the thaw with the united states to accelerate political and economic change on the island.  since arriving in cuba, he has emphasized the importance of service to others, holding out christianity as something greater than ideology.\\xa0 at his last appearance\\xa0on sunday, he went off script, challenging the cuban youth in attendance to dream boldly and chastising nations that rob their young of opportunities to work. a day earlier,\\xa0he also sought to link cuba’s independence with its legacy of catholicism.  “he’s trying to link nationality with faith,” said austen ivereigh, author of “the great reformer,” a biography of francis.  whether francis’ approach to cuba can further revive the cuban church remains unclear. many people in the crowd for the outdoor mass recognized the pope’s mission went beyond preaching catholicism to the masses, perhaps none more than the secular cubans in attendance.  ramon trullo, 69, said he came to see the mass because the pope was someone he considered “a personality on the world stage.”  “his ideas are religious ones, but they are also ones that anyone in the world can identify with,” mr. trullo said. “why shouldn’t we accept his words of justice and equality?”'}\n",

what are you going to do?\". those words changed katharine\\'s life, because they reminded her that, in the end, every christian man and woman, by virtue of baptism, has received a mission. each one of us has to respond, as best we can, to the lord\\'s call to build up his body, the church.\"what about you?\" i would like to dwell on two aspects of these words in the context of our particular mission to transmit the joy of the gospel and to build up the church, whether as priests, deacons, or members of institutes of consecrated life.first, those words - \"what about you?\" - were addressed to a young person, a young woman with high ideals, and they changed her life. they made her think of the immense work that had to be done, and to realize that she was being called to do her part. how many young people in our parishes and schools have the same high ideals, generosity of spirit, and love for christ and the church! do we challenge them? do we make space for them and help them to do their part? to find ways of sharing their enthusiasm and gifts with our communities, above all in works of mercy and concern for others? do we share our own joy and enthusiasm in serving the lord?one of the great challenges facing the church in this generation is to foster in all the faithful a sense of personal responsibility for the church\\'s mission, and to enable them to fulfill that responsibility as missionary disciples, as a leaven of the gospel in our world. this will require creativity in adapting to changed situations, carrying forward the legacy of the past not primarily by maintaining our structures and institutions, which have served us well, but above all by being open to the possibilities which the spirit opens up to us and communicating the joy of the gospel, daily and in every season of our life.\"what about you?\" it is significant that those words of the elderly pope were also addressed to a lay woman. we know that the future of the church in a rapidly changing society will call, and even now calls, for a much more active engagement on the part of the laity. the church in the united states hasalways devoted immense effort to the work of catechesis and education. our challenge today is to build on those solid foundations and to foster a sense of collaboration and shared responsibility in planning for the future of our parishes and institutions. this does not mean relinquishing the spiritual authority with which we have been entrusted; rather, it means discerning and employing wisely the manifold gifts which the spirit pours out upon the church. in a particular way, it means valuing the immense contribution which women, lay and religious, have made and continue to make, to the life of our communities.dear brothers and sisters, i thank you for the way in which each of you has answered jesus\\' question which inspired your own vocation: \"what about you?\". i encourage you to be renewed in the joy of that first encounter with jesus and to draw from that joy renewed fidelity and strength. i look forward to being with you in these days and i ask you to bring my affectionate greetings to those who could not be with us, especially the many elderly priests and religious who join us in spirit.during these days of the world meeting of families, i would ask you in a particular way to reflect on our ministry to families, to couples preparing for marriage, and to our young people. i know how much is being done in your local churches to respond to the needs of families and to support them in their journey of faith. i ask you to pray fervently for them, and for the deliberations of the forthcoming synod on the family.now, with gratitude for all we have received, and with confident assurance in all our needs, let us turn to mary, our blessed mother. with a mother\\'s love, may she intercede for the growth of the church in america in prophetic witness to the power of her son\\'s cross to bring joy, hope and strength into our world. i pray for each of you, and i ask you, please, to pray for me. related topics:religion pope pope francis pope us visit world meeting of families 2015 u.s. & world center city philadelphia load comments related live updates: pope francis in the united states pope us visit video: local family to participate in mass pope francis is in philadelphia | here\\'s his itinerary video: pope francis lands in philadelphia for final us stop video: dann cuellar waits for pope francis at airport more pope us visit religion & spirituality video: local family to participate in mass pope francis is in philadelphia | here\\'s his itinerary video: pope francis lands in philadelphia for final us stop video: dann cuellar waits for pope francis at airport more religion & spirituality top stories live video: action news coverage of pope francis\\' visit live video: live cameras from papal visit video: pope francis lands in philadelphia for final us stop pope francis is in philadelphia | here\\'s his itinerary live updates: pope francis in the united states accuweather: breezy, mild for start of papal visit live traffic conditions on 6abc.com/traffic show more major highways shut down due to papal visit video: erin o\\'hearn reports from eakins oval on papal visit video: katherine scott reports from logan square on papal visit video: dann cuellar waits for pope francis at airport video: nydia han gets ready for papal visit coverage more news map my news photos photos: philadelphia on eve of papal visit video: erin o\\'hearn reports from eakins oval on papal visit photos: pope francis visits 9/11 memorial photos: pope francis in the united states more photos'}\n",
